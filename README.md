# Currency converter
This is a currency converter created using _html,css and javascript._
The currencies to convert to and from are **ksh(Kenyan Shillings), usd(United States Dollar) and bps(British Pound Sterling)**

Currently the rates for selling and buying are constant and do not reflect exactly what is happening in the market with each second.
An API will be incorporated as a source for this to counter this.
