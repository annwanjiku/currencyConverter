# Currency converter
This is a currency converter created using _html,css and javascript._
The currencies to convert to and from are **ksh(Kenyan Shillings), usd(United States Dollar) and bps(British Pound Sterling)**

Currently, the buying and selling rates are fixed and do not accurately reflect real-time market fluctuations. In the future, an API will be integrated to address this issue.
